									<label>Are vaccines safe?</label>
									<p> Vaccines are the safest medicines available. So, absolutely yes! Every vaccine undergoes testing before being licensed , and vaccine saftey continues to be monitored as long as a vaccine is in use. Most of the side effects are minor, such as soreness where the injection was given a low grade fever. These do not last for long are curable easily. Serious reactions are very rare. The tiny risk of a serious reaction from a vaccination has to be weighed against the very real risk of getting a dangerous vaccine-preventable disease.</p>

									<label>Why vaccine? What is the need ?</label>
									<p>Vaccination protects your child against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses. Antibodies are already in place and body knows how to combat it and the personn doesn't get sick. Also called as immmunity!
                                        Unvaccinated children are capable of spreading thr disease to even the vaccinated ones because no vaccine is 100% protective. If a sufficiently high proportion of population is vaccinated against infectious disease, the entire population can obtain protection.									</p>
								</section>

								<section class="toggle">
									<label>Do they side effects?</label>
									<p>They dont! Some common side effets are a fever or sore arm. There is a very small risk that a serious problem could occur after getting a vaccine. However, the potential risks  from the dosease s vaccines prevent are much greater than the potential riska assosciated with the vaccines themselves.   </p>

								<section class="toggle">
									<label>Do vaccines weakens a child immune system?</label>
									<p> No, the immune system makes antibodies against a germ, like the chicken pox virus, whether it encounters it naturally or is exposed </p>
								</section>

								<section class="toggle">
									<label>How to keep a track on the baby's vaccine?</label>
									<p>In many medical practices, your child immunization record is entered into an electronic record keeping system. So be sure to ask for a personal record card or a printed copy of child's vccination. If yu do not receive it , be sure to ask. Your child will get benefit by having an accurate vaccination record throughout his or her life. </p>
								</section>

								<section class="toggle">
									<label>What if i miss an appointment? Does my baby have to restart the vaccines all over again?</label>
									<p>No. If your baby misses some doses, it's not necessary to start over. Your provider can continue from where he left off.   </p>
								</section>

								<section class="toggle">
									<label>What diseases do vaccines protect against?</label>
									<p> Immunizing your baby with vaccines protects against serious diseases like cough, polio, tetanus, rotavirus, hepatitis B, chickenpox, etc.    </p>
								</section>

								<section class="toggle">
									<label>How many times do I need to bring my baby in for vaccinations?</label>
									<p> At least five visits are needed before the age of two. Your baby should get the first vaccine (hepatitis B) at birth, while still in the hospital. Multiple visits are necessary because there are 14 diseases your baby can be protected against. </p>
