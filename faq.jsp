								A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and "remember" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.<br>
								So let us answer some of your queries about it.......

									<label>Why do some parents  don't vaccinate their child? </label>
									<p>Here are some myths regarding vaccination 
									<br>1.So many vaccines so soon will overwhelm my baby's immune system.
									<br>Truth:	With the time disease causing microbes increased exponentially for eg.Parents born in the 1970s and '80s were vaccinated against eight diseases. A fully vaccinated two-year-old today, on the other hand, can beat back 14 diseases.
									<br>2.My child's immune system is immature, so it's safer to delay some vaccines or just get the most important ones.<br>
										Truth:Delaying some vaccines may be very dangerous for eg.In the case of MMR, delaying the vaccine by even three months slightly increases the risk of febrile seizures.ù

									<label>Are vaccines safe?</label>
									<p> Vaccines are the safest medicines available. So, absolutely yes! Every vaccine undergoes testing before being licensed , and vaccine saftey continues to be monitored as long as a vaccine is in use. Most of the side effects are minor, such as soreness where the injection was given a low grade fever. These do not last for long are curable easily. Serious reactions are very rare. The tiny risk of a serious reaction from a vaccination has to be weighed against the very real risk of getting a dangerous vaccine-preventable disease.</p>

									<label>Why vaccine? What is the need ?</label>
									<p>Vaccination protects your child against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses. Antibodies are already in place and body knows how to combat it and the personn doesn't get sick. Also called as immmunity!
                                        Unvaccinated children are capable of spreading thr disease to even the vaccinated ones because no vaccine is 100% protective. If a sufficiently high proportion of population is vaccinated against infectious disease, the entire population can obtain protection.									</p>
