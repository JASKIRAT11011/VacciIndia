								<p>Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease is a serious disease caused by bacteria.  It usually affects children under 5 years old. It can also affect adults with certain medical conditions.<br>
                  The bacteria can cause epiglottitis (severe swelling in the throat that makes it hard to breathe), a serious form of pneumonia, and a disease called bacterial meningitis.<br>
                  Meningitis is an infection of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. <br>Hib meningitis causes death in 1 out of 20 children and permanent brain damage in up to 20 percent of those who survive.<br>
                  Hib, or Haemophilus influenzae type b, can also cause serious joint and skin infections as well as other less common infections.

												<br>It is estimated that mortality due to Hib disease contributes 4% of all annual under-5 deaths in India. The fastidious nature of the Hib bacterium and poor laboratory infrastructure in developing country settings such as India makes the diagnosis of Hib diseases and calculation of disease burden extremely difficult.</p>

											<ol class="list list-ordened list-ordened-style-2 mb-xlg mt-lg">
												<li>Hib vaccine can prevent Hib disease.</li>
												<li>Since use of Hib vaccine began, the number of cases of invasive Hib disease has decreased by more than 99%.</li>
                        <li>Many more children would get Hib disease if we stopped vaccinating.</li>


											</ol>
											Before the vaccines were developed, these diseases were rampant. Vaccines protect the community by preventing the spread of disease from one person to the next, which even offers some protection to the unvaccinated. If people stopped getting vaccinated, the incidence of these three diseases would rapidly rise and thousands would get sick and perhaps even die.
