								<p>Vaccination can protect both children and adults from pneumococcal disease.<br>
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (abbreviated PCV13) is a shot for infants and toddlers.It helps prevent pneumococcal disease, and it also helps stop the disease from spreading from person to person.
 It is now also being given to older adults.<br>

The vaccine’s protection lasts at least 3 years. Because most serious pneumococcal infections happen during the first 2 years of life, the vaccine protects children when they are at greatest risk.

											Before the vaccines were developed, these diseases were rampant. Vaccines protect the community by preventing the spread of disease from one person to the next, which even offers some protection to the unvaccinated. If people stopped getting vaccinated, the incidence of these three diseases would rapidly rise and thousands would get sick and perhaps even die.
