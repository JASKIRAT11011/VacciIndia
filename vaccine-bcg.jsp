								<p>In countries where tuberculosis is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as close to the time of birth as possible.
										The BCG vaccine is the only TB vaccine currently available, although there are other TB vaccines under development. Although far from perfect, the BCG vaccine is a relatively inexpensive, safe, and readily available vaccine that is still the only vaccine available for the prevention of human forms of TB.

											<p>The main use of BCG is for vaccination against tuberculosis. BCG vaccine can be administered after birth intradermally. BCG vaccination is recommended to be given intradermally.
											BCG seems to have its greatest effect in preventing miliary TB or TB meningitis, so it is still extensively used even in countries where efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis is negligible.
											In India, the BCG vaccine is recommended for all babies up to one year old who:

											<p>Avoiding BCG can cause TB to the child.<br>
											TB can affect almost any part of the body, so the symptoms vary and may be different in a baby from those in an adult. However, as TB is infectious, it is important that you can recognise the signs and symptoms. You should get medical help if you, your baby or any other member of your family has:

												<li>been coughing up blood.</li>
