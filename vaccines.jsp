						<p class="lead font-weight-normal mb-xlg pb-xlg"><strong>Vaccinations</strong> can help protect your child from serious diseases caused by germs. Vaccinations are also called vaccines, immunizations, needles, or shots.<br>
						Vaccination protects children from serious illness and complications of vaccine-preventable diseases which can include amputation of an arm or leg, paralysis of limbs, hearing loss, convulsions, brain damage, and death.
						Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and whooping cough, are still a threat. They continue to infect Indian children, resulting in hospitalizations and deaths every year.

									<p class="mb-none">Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis.
										In countries where tuberculosis is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as close to the time of birth as possible.
										The BCG vaccine is the only TB vaccine currently available, although there are other TB vaccines under development. Although far from perfect, the BCG vaccine is a relatively inexpensive, safe, and readily available vaccine that is still the only vaccine available for the prevention of human forms of TB.
