								<p>Children get polio vaccine to protect against polio, or poliomyelitis.<br>
								Polio vaccine is of two types :<br>
								 <b>IPV</b> is given by shot in the leg or arm, depending on the patient’s age.<br>
								 <b>OPV</b> (Oral polio vaccine) is liquid vaccine drops.<br>
								 <b>Oral polio vaccine (OPV)</b>
									<br>The OPV is a live but weakened form of the virus which makes the body produce antibodies against it without developing into the disease. Given as oral drops, it protects not only the person who has taken them but also others living around her.

									<br><b>Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)</b>
									<br>The IPV, on the other hand, while highly effective, only protects the vaccinated person, and not others. It is given by injection.
									<br>This vaccine has recently started being given in fractional doses. India is the first country to introduce fractional doses of the IPV as a way of protecting babies from polio during the current global IPV shortage.
							 <br> We recommend that children get four doses of polio vaccine. They should get one dose at each of the following ages: 2 months old, 4 months old, 6 through 18 months old, and 3 through 5 years old.
