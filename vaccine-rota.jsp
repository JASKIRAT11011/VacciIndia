								<p>Rotavirus is the most common cause of serious diarrhea in babies and young children. It usually affects children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years.<br> Without vaccine, almost all children will have at least one episode of rotavirus diarrhea before they turn 5 years old.<br>
There are two rotavirus vaccines for rotavirus. They are available under these brand names: Rotarix (RV1) and RotaTeq (RV5). Both vaccines are effective.<br>
RotaTeq® (RV5) has been approved for use since 2006, and is given in three doses, one dose at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months of age.<br>
Rotarix® (RV1) has been approved for use since 2008, and is given in two doses, one dose at 2 months and 4 months of age.

												Studies of the rotavirus vaccine have shown that it can prevent : </p>

											<ol class="list list-ordened list-ordened-style-2 mb-xlg mt-lg">
												<li>about 74% of rotavirus infections. </li>
												<li>approximately 98% of severe infections</li>

                        						</ol>
                        					In one hospital, in two years, the number of people with rotavirus dropped from 65 to three.<br>
											Almost all babies who get rotavirus vaccine will be protected from severe rotavirus diarrhea.<br> And most of these babies will not get rotavirus diarrhea at all.										</div>

											<p>Are there any reasons why my baby shouldn’t have the rotavirus vaccine?<br>
											The rotavirus vaccine should not be given to

												<li>Babies with "severe combined immunodeficiency" (SCID) should not get rotavirus vaccine.</li>
												<li>A person who has a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, should not get rotavirus vaccine.</li>

											<p>Rotavirus is caused by viruses from unhygenic places.A rotavirus infection usually starts within two days of exposure to the virus.<br>Initial symptoms are :
											<ol class="list list-ordened list-ordened-style-2 mb-xlg mt-lg">
												<li>Fever</li>
												<li>Vomiting</li>
												<li>Three to seven days of watery diarrhea.</li>
												</ol>
												Rotavirus can be very harmful. Diarrhea, vomiting, and fever can all cause a loss of body fluids. This leads to dehydration, which can be very dangerous, especially for babies and young children.<br> Some children need an IV (needle in their vein) in the hospital to replace lost fluids.
