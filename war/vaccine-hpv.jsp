								<p>HPV is a group of more than 150 related viruses. Each HPV virus in this large group is given a number which is called its HPV type. HPV is named for the warts (papillomas) some HPV types can cause.
HPV vaccine is important because it protects against cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a very common virus; nearly 80 million people—about one in four—are currently infected.<br> About 14 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year.<br>
In India, 122,844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer while 67,477 die from the disease annually.<br> Two vaccines — Gardasil and Cervarix — are available in India. <br>The first is quadrivalent and gives protection from not just HPV but also genital warts among other conditions.<br> Cervarix is bivalent and offers protection from two HPV types.

												HPV infection usually comes from sexual contact, and most people will become infected at some point in their life. About 14 million Americans, including teens, get infected every year. Most infections will go away on their own and not cause serious problems. But thousands of women and men get cancer and other diseases from HPV.
