								<p>The DTaP vaccine protects your child against three diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough).<br>
Diphtheria : <br>
This bacterial infection causes fever, weakness, and a sore throat. A thick, gray coating develops in the back of the throat, which makes it hard to breathe or swallow and sometimes results in suffocation.
<br>Tetanus : <br> (also called lockjaw) is a bacterial infection.The bacteria live in soil and dust and enter the body through a break in the skin. People get tetanus from puncture wounds, burns, and other injuries – sometimes even minor ones.
<br>Pertussis : <br> better known as whooping cough, is a very contagious bacterial infection and one of the most common vaccine-preventable childhood diseases.

												<br>There are majorly 2 types of DTP vaccines. </p>

											<ol class="list list-ordened list-ordened-style-2 mb-xlg mt-lg">
												<li>DTaP is a vaccine that helps children younger than age 7 develop immunity to three deadly diseases caused by bacteria: diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis).</li>
												<li>Tdap is a booster immunization given at age 11 that offers continued protection from those diseases for adolescents and adults.</li>


											</ol>
											Before the vaccines were developed, these diseases were rampant. Vaccines protect the community by preventing the spread of disease from one person to the next, which even offers some protection to the unvaccinated. If people stopped getting vaccinated, the incidence of these three diseases would rapidly rise and thousands would get sick and perhaps even die.
